## Structure and conventions
Each subdirectory contains a `README.md`, with links to the pull request and involved commits for traceability.
In each directory, there are three versions of the affected file:
 1. First parent (prefix `mainline`)
 2. Second parent (prefix `clone`)
 4. Merge commit result (prefix `result`)
