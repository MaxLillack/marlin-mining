 The default baudrate is 250000. This baudrate has less jitter and hence errors than the usual 115200 baud, but is less supported by drivers and host-environments.

 It leads to less over-deposition at corners, especially at flat angles.

 Marlin is able to print those arcs. The advantage is the firmware can choose the resolution,

 If your hardware supports it, you can build yourself a LCD-CardReader+Click+encoder combination. It will enable you to realtime tune temperatures,
