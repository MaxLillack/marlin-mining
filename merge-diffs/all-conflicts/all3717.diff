-It has been adapted to the Ultimaker Printer by:
-Bernhard Kubicek, Matthijs Keuper, Bradley Feldman, and others...
-
-
-Features:
- - Interrupt based movement with real linear acceleration
- - High steprate
- - Look ahead (Keep the speed high when possible. High cornering speed)
- - Interrupt based temperature protection
- - preliminary support for Matthew Roberts advance algorithm 
-   For more info see: http://reprap.org/pipermail/reprap-dev/2011-May/003323.html
- - Full endstop support
- - Simple LCD support (16x2)
