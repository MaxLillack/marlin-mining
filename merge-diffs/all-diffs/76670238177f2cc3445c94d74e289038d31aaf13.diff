 // Only a few motherboards support this, like RAMPS, which have dual extruder support (the 2nd, often unused, extruder driver is used
 // to control the 2nd Z axis stepper motor). The pins are currently only defined for a RAMPS motherboards.
 // On a RAMPS (or other 5 driver) motherboard, using this feature will limit you to using 1 extruder.
