-===============================================
-Instructions for configuring Bed Auto Leveling
-===============================================
-There are two options for this feature. You may choose to use a servo mounted on the X carriage or you may use a sled that mounts on the X axis and can be docked when not in use.
-See the section for each option below for specifics about installation and configuration. Also included are instructions that apply to both options.
-
-Instructions for Both Options
------------------------------
-
-Uncomment the "ENABLE_AUTO_BED_LEVELING" define (commented by default)
-
-The following options define the probing positions. These are good starting values.
-I recommend to keep a better clearance from borders in the first run and then make the probes as close as possible to borders:
-
-* \#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 30
-* \#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 140
-* \#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION 140
-* \#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 30
-
-A few more options:
-
-* \#define XY_TRAVEL_SPEED 6000
-
-X and Y axis travel speed between probes, in mm/min.
-Bear in mind that really fast moves may render step skipping. 6000 mm/min (100mm/s) is a good value.
-
-* \#define Z_RAISE_BEFORE_PROBING 10
-* \#define Z_RAISE_BETWEEN_PROBINGS 10
-
-The Z axis is lifted when traveling to the first probe point by Z_RAISE_BEFORE_PROBING value
-and then lifted when traveling from first to second and second to third point by Z_RAISE_BETWEEN_PROBINGS.
-All values are in mm as usual.
-
-Servo Option Notes
-------------------
-You will probably need a swivel Z-MIN endstop in the extruder. A rc servo do a great job.
-Check the system working here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IKMeOYz-1Q (Enable English subtitles)
-Teasing ;-) video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8eqSQNAyro
-
-In order to get the servo working, you need to enable:
-
-* \#define NUM_SERVOS 1 // Servo index starts with 0 for M280 command
-
-* \#define SERVO_ENDSTOPS {-1, -1, 0} // Servo index for X, Y, Z. Disable with -1
-
-* \#define SERVO_ENDSTOP_ANGLES {0,0, 0,0, 165,60} // X,Y,Z Axis Extend and Retract angles
-
-The first define tells firmware how many servos you have.
-The second tells what axis this servo will be attached to. In the example above, we have a servo in Z axis.
-The third one tells the angle in 2 situations: Probing (165º) and resting (60º). Check this with command M280 P0 S{angle} (example: M280 P0 S60 moves the servo to 60º)
-
-Next you need to define the Z endstop (probe) offset from hotend.
-My preferred method:
-
-* a) Make a small mark in the bed with a marker/felt-tip pen.
-* b) Place the hotend tip as *exactly* as possible on the mark, touching the bed. Raise the hotend 0.1mm (a regular paper thickness) and zero all axis (G92 X0 Y0 Z0);
-* d) Raise the hotend 10mm (or more) for probe clearance, lower the Z probe (Z-Endstop) with M401 and place it just on that mark by moving X, Y and Z;
-* e) Lower the Z in 0.1mm steps, with the probe always touching the mark (it may be necessary to adjust X and Y as well) until you hear the "click" meaning the mechanical endstop was trigged. You can confirm with M119;
-* f) Now you have the probe in the same place as your hotend tip was before. Perform a M114 and write down the values, for example: X:24.3 Y:-31.4 Z:5.1;
-* g) You can raise the z probe with M402 command;
-* h) Fill the defines bellow multiplying the values by "-1" (just change the signal)
-
-* X and Y-Offset must be Integers!
-* \#define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -24
-* \#define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 31
-* \#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -5.1
-
-Sled Option Notes
------------------
-The sled option uses an electromagnet to attach and detach to/from the X carriage. See http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:396692 for more details on how to print and install this feature. It uses the same connections as the servo option.
-
-To use the sled option, you must define two additional things in Configuration.h:
-
-* \#define Z_PROBE_SLED
-* \#define SLED_DOCKING_OFFSET 5
-
-Uncomment the Z_PROBE_SLED to define to enable the sled (commented out by default).
-
-Uncomment the SLED_DOCKING_OFFSET to set the extra distance the X axis must travel to dock the sled. This value can be found by moving the X axis to its maximum position then measure the distance to the right X end and subtract the width of the sled (23mm if you printed the sled from Thingiverse).
-
-Next you need to define the Z endstop (probe) offset from hotend.
-My preferred method:
-
-* a) Home the X and Y axes.
-* b) Move the X axis to about the center of the print bed. Make a mark on the print bed.
-* c) Move the Y axis to the maximum position. Make another mark.
-* d) Home the X axis and use a straight edge to make a line between the two points.
-* e) Repeat (b)-(d) reversing the X and Y. When you are done you will have two lines on the print bed. We will use these to measure the offset for the Z probe endstop.
-* f) Move the nozzle so that it is positioned on the center point of the two lines. You can use fine movement of 0.1mm to get it as close as possible. Note the position of X and Y.
-* g) Zero the Z axis with the G92 Z0 command.
-* h) Raise the Z axis about 20mmm.
-* i) Use the G32 command to retrieve the sled.
-* j) Now more the X and Y axis to the position recorded in (f).
-* k) Lower the Z axis in 0.1mm steps until you hear the "click" meaning the mechanical endstop was trigged. You can confirm with the M119 command. Note the position of the Z axis.
-* l) Make a mark on the print bed where the endstop lever has touched the print bed. Raise the Z-axis about 30mm to give yourself some room.
-* m) Now measure the distance from the center point to the endstop impact site along the X and Y axis using the lines drawn previously.
-* n) Fill in the values below. If the endstop mark is in front of the line running left-to-right, use positive values. If it is behind, use negative values. For the Z axis use the value from (k) and subtract 0.1mm.
-
-For example, suppose you measured the endstop position and it was 20mm to the right of the line running front-to-back, 10mm toward the front of the line running left-to-right, and the value from (k) was 2.85. The values for the defines would be:
-
-* \#define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 20
-* \#define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 10
-* \#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 2.75
-
-That's it.. enjoy never having to calibrate your Z endstop neither leveling your bed by hand anymore ;-)

-Developer Notes
-===================
-
-- There are now 2 branches: The __development__ branch is where new features and code changes will be sorted out. This branch may have untested code in it, so please let us know if you find any bugs. When the __development__ branch has reached a state where it is stable, it will be moved to the __stable__ branch.
-
-- We are doing a kind of cleanup in the list of Issues and Pull Requests, the aim is to get to a state where we can certify the code as stable. To get the code tested as widely as possible we require several volunteers with a wide variety of hardware configurations willing to test the firmware and help us to certify it as stable. If you want to help out testing go to this issue and let us know: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/1209
-
-- Before you submit any pull request, we ask that you _PLEASE_ test your code before submission, even if the change seems innocuous. When creating the pull request, please include the hardware you used for testing and a short synopsis of your testing procedure. Untested pull requests are less likely to be merged, as even slight changes create the risk of breaking the main branch.
-
-- If you have a fix don't open an issue telling about it, but test the code and submit a pull request. Use the __development__ branch when you submit.

-The default baudrate is 250000. This baudrate has less jitter and hence errors than the usual 115200 baud, but is less supported by drivers and host-environments.
-
-## Differences and additions to the already good Sprinter firmware
-
-### Look-ahead
-
-Marlin has look-ahead. While sprinter has to break and re-accelerate at each corner,
-lookahead will only decelerate and accelerate to a velocity,
-so that the change in vectorial velocity magnitude is less than the xy_jerk_velocity.
-This is only possible, if some future moves are already processed, hence the name.
-It leads to less over-deposition at corners, especially at flat angles.
-
-### Arc support
-
-Slic3r can find curves that, although broken into segments, were ment to describe an arc.
-Marlin is able to print those arcs. The advantage is the firmware can choose the resolution,
-and can perform the arc with nearly constant velocity, resulting in a nice finish.
-Also, less serial communication is needed.
-
-### Temperature Oversampling
-
-To reduce noise and make the PID-differential term more useful, 16 ADC conversion results are averaged.
-
-### AutoTemp
-
-If your gcode contains a wide spread of extruder velocities, or you realtime change the building speed, the temperature should be changed accordingly.
-Usually, higher speed requires higher temperature.
-This can now be performed by the AutoTemp function
-By calling M109 S<mintemp> B<maxtemp> F<factor> you enter the autotemp mode.
-
-You can leave it by calling M109 without any F.
-If active, the maximal extruder stepper rate of all buffered moves will be calculated, and named "maxerate" [steps/sec].
-The wanted temperature then will be set to t=tempmin+factor*maxerate, while being limited between tempmin and tempmax.
-If the target temperature is set manually or by gcode to a value less then tempmin, it will be kept without change.
-Ideally, your gcode can be completely free of temperature controls, apart from a M109 S T F in the start.gcode, and a M109 S0 in the end.gcode.
-
-### EEPROM
-
-If you know your PID values, the acceleration and max-velocities of your unique machine, you can set them, and finally store them in the EEPROM.
-After each reboot, it will magically load them from EEPROM, independent what your Configuration.h says.
-
-### LCD Menu
-
-If your hardware supports it, you can build yourself a LCD-CardReader+Click+encoder combination. It will enable you to realtime tune temperatures,
-accelerations, velocities, flow rates, select and print files from the SD card, preheat, disable the steppers, and do other fancy stuff.
-One working hardware is documented here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12663
-Also, with just a 20x4 or 16x2 display, useful data is shown.
-
-### SD card directories
-
-If you have an SD card reader attached to your controller, also folders work now. Listing the files in pronterface will show "/path/subpath/file.g".
-You can write to file in a subfolder by specifying a similar text using small letters in the path.
-Also, backup copies of various operating systems are hidden, as well as files not ending with ".g".
-
-### Autostart
-
-If you place a file auto[0-9].g into the root of the sd card, it will be automatically executed if you boot the printer. The same file will be executed by selecting "Autostart" from the menu.
-First *0 will be performed, than *1 and so on. That way, you can heat up or even print automatically without user interaction.
-
-### Endstop trigger reporting
-
-If an endstop is hit while moving towards the endstop, the location at which the firmware thinks that the endstop was triggered is outputed on the serial port.
-This is useful, because the user gets a warning message.
-However, also tools like QTMarlin can use this for finding acceptable combinations of velocity+acceleration.
-
-### Coding paradigm
-
-Not relevant from a user side, but Marlin was split into thematic junks, and has tried to partially enforced private variables.
-This is intended to make it clearer, what interacts which what, and leads to a higher level of modularization.
-We think that this is a useful prestep for porting this firmware to e.g. an ARM platform in the future.
-A lot of RAM (with enabled LCD ~2200 bytes) was saved by storing char []="some message" in Program memory.
-In the serial communication, a #define based level of abstraction was enforced, so that it is clear that
-some transfer is information (usually beginning with "echo:"), an error "error:", or just normal protocol,
-necessary for backwards compatibility.
-
-### Interrupt based temperature measurements
-
-An interrupt is used to manage ADC conversions, and enforce checking for critical temperatures.
-This leads to less blocking in the heater management routine.

-Filament Sensor
----------------
-Supports the use of a real time filament diameter sensor that measures the diameter of the filament going into the extruder and then adjusts the extrusion rate to compensate for filament that does not match what is defined in the g-code.  The diameter can also be displayed on the LCD screen. This potentially eliminates the need to measure filament diameter when changing spools of filament. Gcode becomes independent of the filament diameter. Can also compensate for changing diameter.
-
-For examples of these sensors, see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:454584, https://www.youmagine.com/designs/filament-diameter-sensor, http://diy3dprinting.blogspot.com/2014/01/diy-filament-diameter-sensor.html. Any sensor which produces a voltage equivalent to the diameter in mm (i.e. 1v = 1mm) can be used. This provides a very simple interface and may encourage more innovation in this area.
-
-4 new Mcodes are defined to set relevant parameters: M404, M405, M406, M407 - see above.
-
- Implements a delay buffer to handle the transit delay between where the filament is measured and when it gets to the extruder.

-Comments start at a `;` (semicolon) and end with the end of the line:
-
-    N3 T0*57 ; This is a comment
-    N4 G92 E0*67
-    ; So is this
-    N5 G28*22
-
-(example taken from the [RepRap wiki](http://reprap.org/wiki/Gcode#Comments))
-
-If you need to use a literal `;` somewhere (for example within `M117`), you can escape semicolons with a `\`
-(backslash):
-
-     M117 Hello \;)
-
-`\` can also be used to escape `\` itself, if you need a literal `\` in front of a `;`:
-
-    M117 backslash: \\;and a comment

-# LCD Language Font System
-
-We deal with a variety of different displays.
-And we try to display a lot of different languages in different scripts on them.
-This system is ought to solve some of the related problems.
-
-## The Displays
-We have two different technologies for the displays:
-
-* Character based displays:
-  Have a fixed set of symbols (charset - font) in their ROM.
-  All of them have a similar but not identical symbol set at the positions 0 to 127 similar to US-ASCII.
-  On the other hand symbols at places higher than 127 have mayor differences.
-  Until now we know of (and support):
-  * 1.) HD44780 and similar with Kana charset A00 https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/HD44780.pdf Page 17
-      These are very common, but sadly not very useful when writing in European languages.
-  * 2.) HD44780 and similar with Western charset A02 https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/HD44780.pdf Page 18
-      These are rare, but fairly useful for European languages. Also a limited number of Cyrillic symbols is available.
-  * 3.) HD44780 and similar with Cyrillic charset http://store.comet.bg/download-file.php?id=466 Page 14
-      Some of our Russian friends use them.
-
-  At all of them you can define 8 different symbols by yourself. In Marlin they are used for the Feedrate-, Thermometer-, ... symbols
-
-* Full graphic displays:
-  Where we have the full freedom to display whatever we want, when we can make a program for it.
-  Currently we deal with 128x64 Pixel Displays and divide this area in about 5 Lines with about 22 columns.
-  Therefore we need fonts with a bounding box of about 6x10.
-  Until now we used a
-  * 1.) Marlin-font similar to ISO10646-1 but with special Symbols at the end, what made 'ü' and 'ä' inaccessible, in the size 6x10.
-  * 2.) Because these letters where to big for some locations on the info-screen we use a full ISO10646-1 font in the size of 6x9.(3200 byte)
-  * 3.) When we define USE_BIG_EDIT_FONT we use an additional ISO10646-1 font with 9x18, eating up another 3120 bytes of progmem - but readable without glasses.
-
-## The Languages
-  For the moment Marlin wants to support a lot of languages:
-  * en    English
-  * pl    Polish
-  * fr    French
-  * de    German
-  * es    Spanish
-  * ru    Russian
-  * it    Italian
-  * pt    Portuguese
-  * pt-br Portuguese (Brazil)
-  * fi    Finnish
-  * an    Aragonese
-  * nl    Dutch
-  * ca    Catalan
-  * eu    Basque-Euskera
-  * cn    Chinese
-  * jp    Japanese (Katakana)
-
-
-## The Problem
-  All of this languages, except the English, normally use extended symbol sets, not contained in US-ASCII.
-  Even the English translation uses some Symbols not in US-ASCII. ( '\002' for Thermometer, STR_h3 for '³')
-  And worse, in the code itself symbols are used, not taking in account, on what display they are written. [(This is true only for Displays with Japanese charset](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/Development/Marlin/ultralcd_implementation_hitachi_HD44780.h#L218) on Western displays you'll see a '~' and on Cyrillic an 'arrow coming from top - pointing to left', what is quite the opposite of what the programmer wanted.)
-  The Germans want to use "ÄäÖöÜüß" the Finnish at least "äö". Other European languages want to see their accents on their letters.
-  For other scripts like Cyrillic, Japanese, Greek, Hebrew, ... you have to find totally different symbol sets.
-
-  Until now the problems where ignored widely.
-  The German translation used utf8 'ä' and 'ö' and did not care about showing garbage on ALL displays.
-  The Russian translators new that their system only works on the Cyrillic character displays and relied on special LCD routines (LiquidCrystalRus.cpp) to handle UTF8 but missed to implement a proper strlen().
-  The Japanese translator dealed with to scripts. He introduced a very special font for the full graphic displays and made use of the Japanese version of the character displays. Therefore he ended up with two pretty unreadable language.h files full of '\xxx' definitions.
-  Other languages ether tried to avoid wording with their special symbols or ignored the problem at all and used the basic symbols without the accents, dots, ... whatever.
-
-## The (partial) Solution
-  On a 'perfect' system like Windows or Linux we'd dig out unifont.ttf and some code from the libraries and they'd do what we want. But we are on a embedded system with very limited resources. So we had to find ways to limit the used space (Alone unifont.ttf is about 12MB) and have to make some compromise.
-
-### Aims:
-  * 1.) Make the input for translators as convenient as possible. (Unicode UTF8)
-  * 2.) Make the displays show the scripts as good as they can. (fonts, mapping tables)
-  * 3.) Don't destroy the existing language files.
-  * 3.) Don't loose to much speed
-  * 4.) Don't loose to much memory.
-
-### Actions:
-  * a.) Declare the display hardware we use. (Configuration.h)
-  * b.) Declare the language ore script we use. (Configuration.h)
-  * c.) Declare the kind of input we use. Ether direct pointers to the font (\xxx) or UTF8 and the font to use on graphic displays. (language_xx.h)
-  * d.) Declare the needed translations. (language_xx.h)
-  * e.) Make strlen() work with UTF8. (ultralcd.cpp)
-  * f.) Seperate the Marlin Symbols to their own font. (dogm_font_data_Marlin_symbols.h)
-  * g.) Make the fontswitch function remember the last used font. (dogm_lcd_implementation.h)
-  * h.) Make output functions that count the number of written chars and switch the font to Marlin symbols and back when needed. (dogm_lcd_implementation.h) (ultralcd_implementation_hitachi_HD44780.h)
-  * i.) Make three fonts to simulate the HD44780 charsets on dogm-displays. With this fonts the translator can check how his translation will look on the character based displays.
-  * j.) Make ISO fonts for Cyrillic and Katakana because they do not need a mapping table and are faster to deal with and have a better charset (less compromises) than the HD44780 fonts.
-  * k.) Make mapping functions and tables to convert from UTF8 to the fonts and integrate in the new output functions. (utf_mapper.h)
-  * l.) Delete the not needed any more 'LiquidCrystalRus.xxx' files and their calls in 'ultralcd_implementation_hitachi_HD44780.h'.
-  * m.) Split 'dogm_font_data_Marlin.h' into separate fonts and delete. (+dogm_font_data_6x9_marlin.h , +dogm_font_data_Marlin_symbols.h, -dogm_font_data_Marlin.h)
-  * n.) Do a bit of preprocessor magic to match displays - fonts and mappers in 'utf_mapper.h'.
-
-## Translators handbook
-  * a.) Check is there already is a language_xx.h file for your language (-> b.) or not (-> e.)
-  * b.) Ether their is declared MAPPER_NON (-> c.) or an other mapper (-> d.)
-  * c.) Symbols outside the normal ASCII-range (32-128) are written as "\xxx" and point directly into the font of the hardware you declared in 'Configuration.h'
-      This is one of the three fonts of the character based Hitachi displays (DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_JAPAN, DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_WEST, DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_CYRILIC).
-      Even on the full graphic displays one of these will be used when SIMULATE_ROMFONT is defined.
-      If you don't make use of the extended character set your file will look like 'language_en.h' and your language file will work on all the displays. 
-      If you make intensive use, your file will look like 'language_kana.h' and your language file will only work on one of displays. (in this case DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_JAPAN)
-      Be careful with the characters 0x5c = '\', and 0x7b - 0x7f. "{|}"These are not the same on all variants.
-      MAPPER_NON is the fastest an least memory consuming variant.
-      If you want to make use of more than a view symbols outside standard ASCII or want to improve the portability to more different types of displays use UTF8 input. That means define an other mapper.
-  * d.) With a mapper different to MAPPER_NON UTF8 input is used. Instead of "\xe1" (on a display with Japanese font) or STR_ae simply use "ä". When the string is read byte by byte , the "ä" will expand to "\0xc3\0xa4" or "Я" will expand to "0xd0\0xaf" or "ホ" will expand to "\0xe3\0x83\0x9b"
-      To limit the used memory we can't use all the possibilities UTF8 gives at the same time. We define a subset matching to the language or script we use.
-      * MAPPER_C2C3 correspondents good with west European languages the possible symbols are listed at (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block))
-      * MAPPER_D0D1 correspondents well with the Cyrillic languages. See (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_(Unicode_block))
-      * MAPPER_E382E383 works with the Japanese Katakana script. See (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana_(Unicode_block))
-
-      The mapper functions will only catch the 'lead in' described in the mappers name. If the input they get does not match they'll put out a '?' or garbage.
-      The last byte in the sequence ether points directly into a matching ISO10646 font or via a mapper_table into one of the HD44780 fonts.
-      The mapper_tables do their best to find a similar symbol in the HD44780_fonts. For example replacing small letters with the matching capital letters. But they may fail to find something matching and will output a '?'. There are combinations of language and display what simply have no corresponding symbols - like Cyrillic on a Japanese display or visa versa - than the compiler will throw an error.
-      In short: Chose a Mapper working with the symbols you want to use. Use only symbols matching the mapper. On FULL graphic displays all will be fine, but check for daring replacements or question-marks in the output of character based displays by defining SIMULATE_ROMFONT and trying the different variants.
-      If you get a lot of question-marks on the Hitachi based displays with your new translation, maybe creating an additional language file with the format 'language_xx_utf8.h' is the way to go.
-      * MAPPER_NON is the fastest and least memory consuming variant.
-      * Mappers together with a ISO10646_font are the second best choice regarding speed and memory consumption. Only a few more decisions are mad per character.
-      * Mappers together with the HD44780_fonts use about additional 128 bytes for the mapping_table.
-  * e.) Creating a new language file is not a big thing. Just make a new file with the format 'language_xx.h' or maybe 'language.xx.utf8.h', define a mapper and a font in there and translate some of the strings defined in language_en.h. You can drop the surrounding  #ifndef #endif. You don't have to translate all the stings - the missing one will be added by language_en.h - in English - of cause.
-  * f.) If you cant find a matching mapper things will be a bit more complex. With the Hitachi based displays you will not have big chance to make something useful unless you have one with a matching charset. For a full graphic display - lets explain with - let's say Greece.
-      Find a matching charset. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_and_Coptic)
-      Provide a font containing the symbols in the right size. Normal ASCII in the lower 127 places, the upper with your selection.
-      Write a mapper catching, in this case, 0xcd to 0xcf and add it to 'utf_mapper.h'.
-      In case of a ISO10646 font we have a MAPPER_ONE_TO_ONE and don't have to make a table.
-  * g.) If you discover enough useful symbols in one of the HD44780 fonts you can provide a mapping table. For example HD44780_WEST contains 'alpha', 'beta', 'pi', 'Sigma', 'omega' 'My' - what is not enough to make USEFUL table - I think.
-  * h.) If you want to integrate an entirely new variant of a Hitachi based display.
-      Add it in 'Configuration.h'. Define mapper tables in 'utf_mapper.h'. Maybe you need a new mapper function. 
-
-  The length of the strings is limited. '17 chars' was crude rule of thumb. Obviously 17 is to long for the 16x2 displays. A more exact rule would be max_strlen = Displaywidth - 2 - strlen(value to display behind). This is a bit complicated. So try and count is my rule of thumb. 
-
-  On the 16x2 displays the strings are cut at the end to fit on the display. So it's a good idea to make them differ early. ('Somverylongoptionname x' -> 'x Somverylongoptionname')
-
-  You'll find all translatable strings in 'language_en.h'. Please don't translate any strings from 'language.h', this may break the serial protocol.
-
-  For information about fonts see: Marlin\fonts\README.fonts
-
-
-## User Instructions
-   Define your hardware and the wanted language in 'Configuration.h'.
-   To find out what charset your hardware is, define language 'test' and compile. In the menu you will see two lines from the upper half of the charset.
-   * DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_JAPAN   locks like "バパヒビピフブプヘベペホボポマミ"
-   * DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_WESTERN locks like "ÐÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜÝÞß"
-   * DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44780_CYRILIC locks like "РСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯ"
-
-   If you get an error about missing mappers during compilation - lie about your displays hardware font to see at lest some garbage, or select an other language.
-   
-   English works on all hardware.

-==============================================
-Instructions for configuring Mesh Bed Leveling
-==============================================
-
-Background
-----------
-
-This mesh based method of leveling/compensating can compensate for an non-flat bed. There are various opinions about doing this. It was primarily written to compensate a RigidBot BIG bed (40x30cm) that was somewhat bent.
-
-Currently there is no automatic way to probe the bed like the Auto Bed Leveling feature. So, you can not enable `ENABLE_AUTO_BED_LEVELING` at the same time. This might soon be implemented though, stay tuned.
-
-Theory
-------
-
-The bed is manually probed in a grid maner. During a print the Z axis compensation will be interpolated within each square using a bi-linear method. Because the grid squares can be tilting in different directions a printing move can be split on the borders of the grid squares. During fast travel moves one can sometimes notice a de-acceleration on these borders. 
-
-Mesh point probing can either be carried out from the display, or by issuing `G29` commands.
-
-The Z-endstop should be set slightly above the bed. An opto endstop is preferable but a switch with a metal arm that allow some travel though should also work.
-
-Configuration
--------------
-
-In `Configuration.h` there are two options that can be enabled.
-
-`MESH_BED_LEVELING` will enable mesh bed leveling.<br/>
-`MANUAL_BED_LEVELING` will add the menu option for bed leveling.
-
-There are also some values that can be set.
-
-The following will set the step distance used when manually turning the display encoder. Default is 0.025
-
-`MBL_Z_STEP` 
-
-Following four define the area to cover. Default 10mm from max bed size
-
-`MESH_MIN_X`<br/>
-`MESH_MAX_X`<br/>
-`MESH_MIN_Y`<br/>
-`MESH_MAX_Y`
-
-Following two define the number of points to probe, total number will be these two multiplied. Default is 3x3 points. Don't probe more than 7x7 points (software limited)
-
-`MESH_NUM_X_POINTS`<br/> 
-`MESH_NUM_Y_POINTS`<br/>
-
-The following will set the Z-endstop height during probing. When initiating a bed leveling probing, a homing will take place and the Z-endstop will be set to this height so lowering through the endstop can take place and the bed should be within this distance. Default is 4mm
-
-`MESH_HOME_SEARCH_Z`
-
-The probed points will also be saved in the EEPROM if it has been enables. Otherwise a new probe sequence needs to be made next time the printer has been turned on.
-
-Probing the bed with the display
---------------------------------
-
-If `MANUAL_BED_LEVELING` has been enabled then will a `Level bed` menu option be available in the `Prepare` menu.
-
-When selecting this option the printer will first do a homing, and then travel to the first probe point. There it will wait. By turning the encoder on the display the hotend can now be lowered until it touches the bed. Using a paper to feel the distance when it gets close. Pressing the encoder/button will store this point and then travel to the next point. Repeating this until all points have been probed.
-
-If the EEPROM has been enable it can be good to issue a `M500` to get these points saved.
-
-Issuing a `G29` will return the state of the mesh leveling and report the probed points.
-
-Probing the bed with G-codes
-----------------------------
-
-Probing the bed by G-codes follows the sequence much like doing it with the display.
-
-`G29` or `G29 S0` will return the state of the bed leveling and report the probed points. Where X=1 Y=1 is the top-left value and X=MESH_NUM_X_POINTS Y=MESH_NUM_Y_POINTS is bottom-right value. X per column and Y per row.
-
-`G29 S1` will initiate the bed leveling, homing and traveling to the first point to probe.
-
-Then use your preferred Printer controller program, i.e. Printrun, to lower the hotend until it touches the bed. Using a paper to feel the distance when it gets close.
-
-`G29 S2` will store the point and travel to the next point until last point has been probed.
-
-`G29 S3 Xn Yn Zn.nn` will modify a single probed point. This can be used to tweak a badly probed point. Specify probe point where `Xn` and `Yn`, where `n` in `Xn` is between 1 and `MESH_NUM_X_POINTS`. Likewise for `Yn`. `Zn.nn` is the new Z value in that probed point. 
-
-Note
-----
-
-Depending how firm feel you aim for on the paper you can use the `Z offset` option in Slic3r to compensate a slight height diff. (I like the paper loose so I needed to put `-0.05` in Slic3r)

-__Note for RAMPS users:__
-----------------------
-
--By default, RAMPS have no power on servo bus (if you happen to have a multimeter, check the voltage on servo power pins).
--In order to get the servo working, you need to supply 5V to 5V pin.. You can do it using your power supply (if it has a 5V output) or jumping the "Vcc" from Arduino to the 5V RAMPS rail.
--These 2 pins are located just between the Reset Button and the yellow fuses... There are marks in the board showing 5V and VCC.. just connect them..
--If jumping the arduino Vcc do RAMPS 5V rail, take care to not use a power hungry servo, otherwise you will cause a blackout in the arduino board ;-)

+//===========================================================================
+/*
+This is a feature to protect your printer from burn up in flames if it has
+a thermistor coming off place (this happened to a friend of mine recently and
+motivated me writing this feature).
+
+The issue: If a thermistor come off, it will read a lower temperature than actual.
+The system will turn the heater on forever, burning up the filament and anything
+else around.
+
+After the temperature reaches the target for the first time, this feature will
+start measuring for how long the current temperature stays below the target
+minus _HYSTERESIS (set_temperature - THERMAL_RUNAWAY_PROTECTION_HYSTERESIS).
+
+If it stays longer than _PERIOD, it means the thermistor temperature
+cannot catch up with the target, so something *may be* wrong. Then, to be on the
+safe side, the system will he halt.
+
+Bear in mind the count down will just start AFTER the first time the
+thermistor temperature is over the target, so you will have no problem if
+your extruder heater takes 2 minutes to hit the target on heating.

-## Quick Information
-
-This is a firmware for reprap single-processor electronics setups.
-It also works on the Ultimaker PCB. It supports printing from SD card+Folders and look-ahead trajectory planning.
-This firmware is a mashup between [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter), [grbl](https://github.com/simen/grbl), and many original parts.
+ Documentation has moved to http://www.marlinfirmware.org
