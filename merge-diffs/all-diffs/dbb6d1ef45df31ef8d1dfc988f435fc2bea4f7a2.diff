 You can download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases). (The latest "stable" release of Marlin is 1.0.2-1.)
 
-You'll always find the latest Release Candidate in the ["RC" branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC). Bugs that we find in the current Release Candidate are patched in the ["RCBugFix" branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC), so during beta testing this is where you can always find the latest code on its way towards release.
