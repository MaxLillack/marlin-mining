+// Ensure Smooth Moves
+//
+// Enable this option to prevent the machine from stuttering when printing multiple short segments.
+// This feature uses two strategies to eliminate stuttering:
+//
+// 1. During short segments a Graphical LCD update may take so much time that the planner buffer gets
+//    completely drained. When this happens pauses are introduced between short segments, and print moves
+//    will become jerky until a longer segment provides enough time for the buffer to be filled again.
+//    This jerkiness negatively affects print quality. The ENSURE_SMOOTH_MOVES option addresses the issue
+//    by pausing the LCD until there's enough time to safely update.
+//
+//    NOTE: This will cause the Info Screen to lag and controller buttons may become unresponsive.
+//          Enable ALWAYS_ALLOW_MENU to keep the controller responsive.
+//
+// 2. No block is allowed to take less time than MIN_BLOCK_TIME. That's the time it takes in the main
+//    loop to add a new block to the buffer, check temperatures, etc., including all blocked time due to
+//    interrupts (without LCD update). By enforcing a minimum time-per-move, the buffer is prevented from
+//    draining.
